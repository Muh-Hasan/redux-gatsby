Attracted by a career that combined working with people and the application of science, Wilson decided to pursue medicine early in college.
            <br><br>Dr. Wilson says that a urologist has the privilege of true continuity of care – meeting the patient and their family, often thereafter performing an operation, taking care of the patient in hospital, and providing follow up care often for years afterward. “I have the ability to really get to know the people I’m treating, and that makes the job satisfying. There’s nothing like a patient giving me a big hug and thanking me for helping them.”
            <br><br>Dr. Wilson is experienced in robotic surgery of the adrenal gland, bladder, kidney, prostate, and ureter, as well as treatment of large and complex kidney stones. He participated in multiple city-wide cancer care case presentations while in Pittsburgh, all of which were surgeries he performed robotically and selected by a panel of oncology experts for their complexity. Additionally, he is experienced in all general urologic issues, including enlarged prostate or BPH, voiding dysfunction of men and women, men’s health and sexual dysfunction.
            <br><br>Wilson is married with two children. He enjoys time with his family and loves “anything outdoors,” including scuba diving as a PADI certified Advanced Open Water and Enriched Air Diver, long distance running and obstacle races, skiing, biking, hiking and sports of all kinds.`,
