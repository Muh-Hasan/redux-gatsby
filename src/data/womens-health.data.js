        "Bladder leakage, also known as urinary incontinence, is the loss of bladder control or involuntary loss of urine. It’s far more common than many people realize, with 1 in 3 women experiencing this condition. Unfortunately, many people don’t realize that simple treatment options are available. We will diagnose the specific type of incontinence and talk about available treatment options to help our patient have more freedom and comfort in their daily life.",

        "In the simplest of descriptions, vaginal prolapse is when the vagina slips out of place. If you are feeling pressure (which decreases when reclining), pain during intercourse, or recurrent urinary tract infections you may be suffering from this condition. Women with this condition can be diagnosed through a physical exam and specific tests. In most cases, surgery is required to fix this problem but the good news is most cases are fully curable.",

The most common symptoms include an increase in the need to urinate, a strong urge to pass urine but pain when doing so, back pain on one side, or even blood in the urine. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics and will fully clear up. In some cases, there can be complications when occur when the infection travels to the kidneys, which causes excruciating pain in the back. In this situation it’s very important to see a doctor and get treatment right away.",

      sectionCopy2:
        "Kidney stones can be painful and usually start with a sharp cramping and discomfort in the back, side or lower abdomen. For women, the prevalence of kidney stones peaks when they reach their 50’s. Most kidney stones can pass without needing a doctor’s intervention. However, some cause complications and pain that require treatment such as noninvasive lithotripsy to break up the stones or surgery in some cases. Once one develops a kidney stone other stones are likely to occur.",
