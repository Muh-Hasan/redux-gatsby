        "Two of the most common disorders of the prostate are prostatis and benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. These conditions are similar with symptoms of swelling or enlargement of the prostate gland and difficulty with urine flow and frequency. However, with prostatis there is oftentimes pain during urination or in the abdomen or penis. Treatment for prostatis is usually antibiotics or pain relievers depending on the type of condition. Treatment for BPH involves phytotherapy or Alpha-blockers, or minimally invasive surgical options.",

Causes of incontinence can be due to physical activity, prostate enlargement, scarring in the urethra or a dysfunctional bladder. Treatment options available include pharmacological medications, injections or surgical options that include implantations to control incontinence.",

Some cases are mild but others may require intervention to improve one’s sex life. Our specialists can evaluate and plan the right course of treatment. Treatment for ED can sometimes be done through lifestyle changes such as doing more exercise, quitting smoking or losing weight. Other treatment options include oral medication, injections, vacuum device or a penile implant.",

Male infertility can stem from several issues including low sperm count, infection, tumor or hormonal imbalance. After the initial consultation, questionnaire and necessary testing and health assessment have been completed, we can determine the root cause and begin to explore treatment options. Treatments may include surgery, medication or hormone treatments.",

Symptoms such as fatigued, trouble concentrating, diminished performance at work or a decreased sex drive, may be an indication of low testosterone We will conduct the A.D.A.M questionnaire to determine if low testosterone is possible. Next, lab tests will be done to determine an appropriate therapy, such as a patch or oral medication, to best improve sperm count.",

We’re here to provide guidance to help determine if there is a solution. It may be possible to be treated in a single office visit—this is especially true if PE is newly acquired, rather than a lifelong problem. One thing to note, PE is a different condition than erectile dysfunction (ED). A physician will be able to confirm if the issue is PE or ED.",

Peyronie’s is most common in men over 50. Many things can determine the treatment plan, including the degree of the curvature, the severity of penile shortening, any narrowing and whether erectile dysfunction is also an issue. Several treatment options are available with the goal of regaining or maintaining sexual function through straightening the penis.",

Stones occur more frequently in men and prevalence of stones raises dramatically as men enter their 40’s and continues to rise into their 70’s. Most kidney stones can pass without needing a doctor’s intervention. However, some cause complications and pain that require treatment such as lithotripsy to break up the stones or surgery in some cases. Once you develop a kidney stone other stones are likely to occur.",

The procedure has a low risk of complications and can usually be performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia. Vasectomy offers no protection from sexually transmitted infections. Vasectomy is considered a permanent form of male birth control and is nearly 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Since this procedure is not always reversible, it’s important that the patient be sure they don’t want to father a child in the future before considering a vasectomy.",
